 <h3 align="center"> Get to know me... </h3>
  <p align="center"> I am a Developer in a small team, mainly working on automating solutions and networking, with a side passion for Cyber Security. 
  </p><br>
  <p align="center">So far I have learnt everything I know by myself, playing around with Linux in virtual machines and using it on old hardware, as well as completing many online courses through sites such as <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>. <br>
Through this exploration I also discovered and worked with different tools, such as Splunk and Wireshark. 
</p>
  <h3 align="center"> Achievements. </h3>
  <p align="center"> - Cisco CCNA </p><br>
  <p align="center"> - ISC2 CC </p><br>
  
<p align="center"> Since getting into my job role, I have worked with enterprise level virtualisation (VMware ESX and VSCA) which hosts both Linux and Windows machines. <br>
I have learnt how to configure and secure these machines, as well as working with the networking behind the infrastructure; both in virtual and physical routing/switching.
</p>
  
<p align="center"> This then lead to learning certain tools, related to a SOC Analyst role on a <u>**basic to intermediate level**.</u> <br>
Such tools involve; Splunk, Zeek, Cisco Firepower and ADSM, Microsoft System Center Operation Manager (SCOM).
</p>

<p align="center"> I am looking at furthering my Splunk knowledge through a Splunk Certification and completing some CompTia Certifications. </p>

<p align="center"> Some of my recent achievements are; automating the deployment of Splunk Forwarders within a domain of Linux boxes as there is no easy way to deploy forwarders to mass group of Linux boxes unlike Windows which can use Group Policy, especially in an offline environment which has no connection to the internet. The script checks the current version and if it matches the version you are wanting to update too, it will stop otherwise it will pull the new version down and create a backup of the current forwarder. Then it will update it, to the new version. The script at the same time, also checks if a Splunk Forwarder is installed and if it isn't, installs one. </p> <br>
<p align="center"> I have also recently passed my Cisco CCNA Exam. Whilst not a huge exam in the world of networking, I was eager to prove I have a base knowledge and awareness of networks, to now build my career off. A few months later, I passed ISC2 Certified in Cyber Security exam too, providing me with a basic knowledge of enterprise Cyber Security. </p>

<h2 align="center"> Languages and Tools: </h2>
    <h4 align="center">These are some of the technologies I have worked with, some more depth than others.<br>
    I have also had exposure to Powershell and working with API's such as REST API with Splunk.
